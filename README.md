The following code has been used to create the figures and tables in the paper "Tool use by New World Halichoeres" by Tariel-Adam et al. 

# Create tables
All data are in Notion tables.  
The script 'Create-table.R' converts the exported table from Notion into:
- a final table in csv format
- a table used for the map figure in csv format
- a table in Google Sheets

# Create the map
The script 'Create-map.R' create the map from the location of observations and from the point distribution of New World Halichoeres species.
